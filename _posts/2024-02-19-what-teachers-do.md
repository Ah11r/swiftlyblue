*This Book delivers some useful methodologies employed by the best colleges in their content delivery*

The best teachers have;
    Knowledge of the discipline at hand
    Keen sense of the histories of their disciplines - this leads to metacongnition(ability to think about their own thinking)`

Key concepts from the survey
1. Knowledge is constructed, Not Received
	- We construct our sense of reality out of all the sensory inputs we receive
	- We use our existing mental models to shape the sensory inputs we receive`
2. Mental Models Change Slowly
	To stimulate students to build new models, they must:
	    - face a situation in which their mental model will not work
	    - care that their mental model doesn't work, strongly enough to stop and grapple with the issue at hand
	    - be able to handle the emotional trauma that sometimes accompanies challenges to longstanding beliefs
Students may find so much emotional comfort in some existing model of reality
- Ask questions that help students see their own mistakes
- Students must first know the basic facts of the discipline to be able to think, analyze, synthesize and make judgements
- Make the students see why they need to remember some piece of information and why some certain facts drives the understanding`
