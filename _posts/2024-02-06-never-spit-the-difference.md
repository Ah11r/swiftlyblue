*Life is Negotiation*

The first step in achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating
#### Seeding more warmth into an interaction(esp tense situation)
	Use an apology and mention the name

#### Tactics / Tecniques
	1. Open ended questions/ calibrated questions - queries that the other party can answer but have no fixed answers --> Buys you time and gives the opponent a false idea of control
	2. Based on Kahneman's research - 'Thinking, fast and slow', Influencing the subconcious mind(System 1 - fast, instinctive and emotional), gifts you control on the conscious mind (System 2 - the slow, deliberative and logical)

#### Vocabularies
	1. Languid (my counterpart was a languid guy) --> 
	2. redhead (do not be a redhead) -->
	3. Smiling like the Cheshire cat
	4. Haggle --> 
	5. Inchoate -->

#### Great Minds Research Nuggets
	Getting to Yes principles
		1. Separate the person(the emotion) from the problem
		2. Don't get wrapped up in the other side's position(what they are asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they are asking for it - know why they want it)
		3. Work cooperatively to generate win-win options
		4. Establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions
	
	Tversky & Kahneman Research (Thinking, Fast and Slow)
		* Framing effect -  demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed
		* Prospect theory - explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses
		* Loss Aversion - shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain
	
	Psycotherapy research / Techniques
		* Listening is the cheapest and yet the most effective concession - it demonstrates empathy and sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
		* Tactical Empathy --> Listening as a martial art i.e. balancing the subtle behaviours of emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence
